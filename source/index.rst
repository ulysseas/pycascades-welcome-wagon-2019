Pro Tips
--------

-  You don't need to go to every talk. Look through the schedule of
   events before you arrive or while you are eating or taking a break.
   Figure out which talks you want to see the most. Spread out your time
   between talks, networking, and breaks.

-  Speaking of breaks--conferences are exhilarating, but can also be
   exhausting. Give your brain a break! Grab a quiet spot in the Backstage
   Lounge [TBA] or take a quick walk. Play a board game on your lunch break.
   Come back invigorated.

-  Eat! You can use the energy.

-  Are you looking for a job or is there an opening at your company?
   Check out the job board in ??.
